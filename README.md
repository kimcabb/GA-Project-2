# The SowGood Farms Community App

My app will allow users to create/read/update/delete basic crop data, based on seasons of the year.  This app is based on a two-model system, Season and Crop.  Seasons have crops, and crops belong to seasons.

The idea for this app came from my desire to have (in one place and on a small scale) information on appropriate food crops to plant based on the time of year (herbs, veg, fruits).  With further modification, I would like to allow the user to enter location information that will further refine the data returned when queried (or "auto detect", if possible).  For now, all data are based on generalized location information for the Eastern U.S.

Please see the "planning" directory for wireframe, ERD and user story data.

Added functionality (work in progress):
  Farmer's Market model
  OAuth using Twitter and Facebook Sign-in
  Online Shopping Cart
  Improved Styling
